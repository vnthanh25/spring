This application uses http://projects.spring.io/spring-security[Spring Security] with http://angularjs.org[Angular JS] in a "single page application" where the UI and resource servers are separate, and secured using a shared token store implemented with https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/[Spring Session].

It is one of a pair of samples from an section and both are described in more detail https://github.com/dsyer/spring-security-angular/tree/master/vanilla/README.md[here].
